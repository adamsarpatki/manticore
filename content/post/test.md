![Eden's retreat](/img/postcard-1_finished_watermarked.jpg)

_Eden’s Retreat is a small area located in the temperate climate of its continent, protected by mountains. Its lush vegetation, and crystalline lakes and rivers make it the perfect place for a weekend getaway — for some camping or fishing. True, unwary travelers might meet a grizzly or two, but if they’re lucky, due to the area’s almost magical serenity, the bear will be content with some fishes from the lake._

This map was inspired by a photo that was taken in Canada. Since I’m relatively new to Rebelle, an excellent art software, I wanted to practice on a smaller piece. No sense in starting a large region or continent map without knowing what I can/should do and what I can’t/shouldn’t. So this turned out to be a postcard or A6-sized map, which, given its vacation-y theme, is nice. I’m planning on drawing other smaller postcards, maybe even doing a whole series — this format is great for practicing not just the software, but also more difficult elements. You can experiment a lot without wasting a lot of time if things don’t work out.

If you’re interested in the map without the watermark, be sure to check out [the finished piece on Artstation](https://www.artstation.com/artwork/49R0rk) where I also show some progress photos.

Oh, and I also have a Youtube channel for the timelapse videos.

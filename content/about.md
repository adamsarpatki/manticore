I have a professional background in library science, but I’m currently working as a freelance literary translator and editor for several Hungarian publishers — at this point, I’ve worked on more than 50 books. I have publications ranging from fantasy novels to library science articles.

So you might ask the question: why do I want to switch to UX design?

I think a part of me was always interested in UX, just didn’t have the word for it. But now that I’m learning more and more about it, I realise a lot of the things a librarian does is related to UX: answering reference questions, understanding your patrons’ needs and problems, organizing information using various classification systems, helping patrons find what they’re looking for, saving them a lot of time and effort. Sounds familiar?

Since I graduated from university in 2012, I’ve encountered a lot of software that wasn’t user-friendly. So that taught me how important it is to have human-centred solutions, and now I want to make a positive impact by creating these solutions.

That’s why, in March 2021, I’ve enrolled in Udacity’s UX Nanodegree Program. I’ve learned a lot about the concepts and processes of UX, but it didn’t teach me everything, so I’m always looking for new challenges and projects to try my hand at. Hey, I’ve even designed and developed this website by hand.

I have a generalist mindset: I love working on complex projects from the research phase to development, but since written language has been such an integral part of my life, I am an advocate of clear UX writing and good localization.

Outside of UX, I like to spend my time messing around in Blender, knitting, playing RPGs and video games. I also love cooking, painting miniatures, and drawing fantasy maps.
